# Question 2:
You are an admin on a server with multiple users. You find an unknown process running. You donâ€™t want to kill it yet. How do you determine what exactly the process is doing and whether it is malicious?

## Answer:
- to gather the info about the process we can use `lsof` to open network connections and files associated with that process. to get idea of what resources the process is accessing and using `strace` we could trace system calls  made by that process.
- using `ps -efww` adn filtering out the process with required pid we could a better idea of process.
- We can then inspect the script that the process is running. comparing it with known malware hashes. 
- Monitor processes filesystem activities using `auditd`, network activity and connections using `lsof`. Analyze process's memory using `gcore` or `memmap`.

Hence, make decision wheather the process is malicious or not.
