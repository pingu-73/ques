# Question4:
Suppose you want to run a website on your computer in the LAN. You want your friends to be able to access it with a URL like rishav.iiit.ac.in, but you do not want to get any official approval.
1.  Describe how you would go about it. What instructions you would give to your friends so they can access your website (bonus: will your solution work for any generic xyz.iiit.ac.in?)
2.  (extra credit) Suppose you wish to allow people anywhere on the internet to access your websites. What are the steps you think that us, as sysadmins, would have to follow?
